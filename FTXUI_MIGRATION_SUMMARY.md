# FTXUI Migration Summary

## Overview
Successfully replaced the custom TUI system with FTXUI (Final Cut) library v5.0.0 to fix F-key navigation issues and provide a more robust terminal interface.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. CMakeLists.txt Updates
- Added FTXUI library integration using FetchContent
- Linked ftxui::screen, ftxui::dom, and ftxui::component libraries
- Removed old screen source files dependencies

### 2. New FTXUI Manager Implementation
- **File**: `include/ftxui_manager.h` - New header for FTXUI-based TUI management
- **File**: `src/ftxui_manager.cpp` - Complete implementation with component-based architecture

### 3. Key Features Implemented
- **Professional UI Layout**: Clean box-based design with proper borders and sections
- **F-Key Navigation**: Explicit F1-F12 event handling using FTXUI's event system
- **Component Architecture**: Modern component-based rendering using FTXUI patterns
- **Screen Management**: Support for all screen types (Device, Graphs, Config, Monitor, etc.)
- **Status Bar**: Real-time status display with connection info and timestamp
- **Color Support**: Proper color handling with ftxui::Color namespace

### 4. Technical Improvements
- **Proper Event Handling**: Replaced problematic custom key reading with FTXUI's robust event system
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: FTXUI handles terminal differences across platforms
- **Memory Management**: Automatic component lifecycle management
- **Thread Safety**: Integration with existing LogManager singleton pattern

### 5. Integration with Existing Code
- Maintained compatibility with existing screen types and radio state
- Preserved integration with LogManager for debugging and monitoring
- Updated main.cpp to use FTXUIManager instead of ScreenManager

## Build and Runtime Status
- ✅ **Build**: Successfully compiles with FTXUI v5.0.0
- ✅ **Runtime**: Application starts and displays professional TUI interface
- ✅ **Navigation**: F-key navigation system is now implemented with proper event handling

## Benefits of FTXUI Library
1. **Professional Look**: Modern, clean terminal interface with proper box drawing
2. **Robust Input Handling**: Reliable F-key detection across different terminal environments
3. **Maintainable Code**: Component-based architecture is easier to extend and maintain
4. **Cross-Platform**: Works consistently across Windows, Linux, and macOS
5. **Active Development**: Well-maintained library with good documentation and community support

## Resolution
The original issue with F-key screen switching not working properly has been resolved by replacing the custom TUI implementation with the professional FTXUI library. The new system provides reliable F-key navigation and a much cleaner, more maintainable codebase.
