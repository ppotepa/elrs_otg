# ELRS OTG Demo (On Hold)

## Overview
This repository hosts experiments for driving ExpressLRS transmitters from a Windows host over USB. Earlier iterations focused on a C++ control and telemetry console that exercised TX power management, binding routines, and spectrum visualisation.

## Current Status
Development is paused. The project will continue as soon as I find proper USB IART conversion hardware that delivers a stable electrical and protocol bridge between the host and the transmitter.

## Next Steps (Pending Hardware)
- Source and validate the required USB IART conversion interface
- Reconnect the telemetry pipeline and refresh the UI tooling
- Resume automation around binding, TX power sweeps, and diagnostics

## Stay Tuned
Have a lead on dependable USB IART conversion gear or want to collaborate once hardware arrives? Please open an issue or get in touchâ€”updates will resume the moment the right adapter is on the bench.
